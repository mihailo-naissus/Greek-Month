# Greek-Month
To use this feature, a user simply needs to input a date,

and the software will output the corresponding ancient Greek month.

This feature can be useful for those interested in ancient Greek culture and history,

as the ancient Greeks used a lunar calendar with months that were named after their corresponding lunar phases.
